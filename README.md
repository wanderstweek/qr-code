## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Since I have some very basic expirience with HTML & CSS, this project was relativly easy for me to build. With this project I mostly learned how to push project to GitHub repository and how to publish project on GitHub Pages.


### Continued development

My plan is to continue with the challenges from FrontendMentor. This is only the beggining and I'm very exited to continue learning. For now, only HTML & CSS....


### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I use this site as a starting point for learning the basics. Not only HTML and CSS but for SQL, Python and JavaScript.
